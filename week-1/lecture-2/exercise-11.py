# Below are some short Python programs. For each program, answer the associated 
# questions.
# 
# Try to answer the questions without running the code. Check your answers, then 
# run the code for the ones you get wrong. You'll learn the most this way, by 
# figuring things out, instead of just running the code and reading off the 
# answers.
