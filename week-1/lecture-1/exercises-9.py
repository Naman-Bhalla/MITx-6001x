# Below is a transcript of a session with the Python shell. For each expression 
# being evaluated, provide the type and the value the expression returns. If 
# evaluating an expression would cause an error, select 'NoneType' and write 
# the word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string, no quotes) in the box. 
# While you could simply type these expressions into your IDE, we encourage you 
# to answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of 
# basic Python expressions.
# 
# Assume that the expressions are evaluated in the order shown - that is, each 
# problem part is evaluated directly after the previous problem part(s).
# 
# 1.) 
# >>> a = 3
# >>> a == 5.0
# >>> a 
# 
# Ans :-
# int
# 3
# 
# 2.)
# >>> b = 10
# >>> c = b > 9
# >>> c 
# 
# Ans :-
# bool
# True
