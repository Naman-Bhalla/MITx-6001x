# Below is a transcript of a session with the Python shell. For each expression 
# being evaluated, provide the type and the value the expression returns. If 
# evaluating an expression would cause an error, select 'NoneType' and write the 
# word 'error' (note this is a word, not a string, no quotes) in the box. While 
# you could simply type these expressions into your IDE, we encourage you to 
# answer them directly since this will help reinforce your understanding of basic 
# Python expressions.
# 
# Assume that the expressions are evaluated in the order shown - that is, each 
# problem part is evaluated directly after the previous problem part(s).
# 
# 1.) 
# >>> a = 3
# >>> a + 2.0 
# 
# Ans :-
# 5.0
# float
# 
# 2.)
# >>> a = a + 1.0
# >>> a 
# 
# Ans :-
# 4.0
# float
# 
# 3.)
# >>> a = 3
# >>> b
# 
# Ans :-
# error
# NoneType
