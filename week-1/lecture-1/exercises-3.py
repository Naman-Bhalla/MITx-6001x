# 1.) True or False? A stored program computer is designed to compute precisely 
# one computation, such as a square root, or the trajectory of a missile.
# 
# Ans :-
# False
# 
# 2.) True or False? A fixed program computer is designed to run any computation, 
# by interpreting a sequence of program instructions that are read into it.
# 
# Ans :-
# False
# 
# 3.) A program counter
# 
# Ans :-
# points the computer to the next instruction to execute in the program.
# 
# 4.) What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence 
# executing some computation"?
# 
# Ans :-
# The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except 
# sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.
# 
# My Special Remarks On This :-
# Well, initially I was also confused on this as I was thinking that computer
# always executes instructions in a Linear Sequence. Later, after further going
# through the course, I realized that in looping conditions or if a break statement
# is put, the computer jumps to a different place in the sequence and thus this
# answer.
# 
# 5.) True or False? In order to compute everything that is computable, every 
# computer must be able to handle the sixteen most primitive operations.
# 
# Ans :-
# False
# 
# Staff Explanation :-
# Alan Turing proved that all problems can be computed with only 6 primitives!
