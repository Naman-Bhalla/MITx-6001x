# 3.) A recipe for deducing the square root involves guessing a starting value 
# for y. Without another recipe to be told how to pick a starting number, the 
# computer cannot generate one on its own.
# 
# Ans :-
# True
# 
# Staff Explanation :-
# The recipe in question, by itself, says to start with a guess. But in order to 
# make this guess, we would need to have another recipe for how to guess! 
# Examples of such recipes include to use a fixed number, or a pseudorandom 
# number generator, to give 2 examples. So by itself, the recipe in question is 
# not sufficient to be made into a real program. This question is indicative of 
# how you should not assume you have more info than what the problem specifies.
